# 311 Service Request Tracker
This application allows users to track their 311 service request by its ID. It
uses the [pattern portfolio](http://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/patterns/) to
provide a consistent experience. It was inspired by the
[trash day app](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/trashday).
